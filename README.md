# NovelHub w/ Vue.js, Golang, and Postgres
NovelHub is a Vue application that mixes an e-book service with social media. Authors can like and upload books as well as become fans of other authors.

It uses Go as its backend and API. The [Gorm]("https://github.com/go-gorm/gorm") framework is used to help improve the structure of both the server and the PostgresSQL database so that communication between them is painless. This is also my first Vue application.
